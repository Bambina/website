To archive a query, open the little menu at the top-right area of the query editor, next to the Save option:

{% doc_img /assets/images/docs/archive_query.png %}

While there is no option to delete a query, archiving it is almost the same: after archiving a query it won't show up in search results or your recent queries, will be removed from all dashboards and alerts.
